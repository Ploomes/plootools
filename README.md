# PlooTools üõ†Ô∏è
Extension created to assist front-end development in creating components in react with a code pattern used at Ploomes, and also to create test files in the JEST pattern.

### Modify the structure of how the files will be built (new)
By right-clicking and starting with Plootools init, we can manipulate how the models will be built in the project.

## Create function and test files
When you run the Create function and test command, it will intelligently create a file with the function in typescript or javascript, and it will create a test file if one does not exist.
